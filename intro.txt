Hello, my name is Marcus Dunn. This will hopfully be around for a while (but I do say that for all my little side projects). I want to go into politics so I've decided to fuck myself by posting all my 19 year old opinions online. Hopfully the gimmick of this blog (being able to go back and such) will show some improvment with time, or perhaps I'll become a cyncal asshole with age, who's to know! 

The goal of this is to see if I can continue to write dispite taking a major that requires all of zero words. Also giving me some sort of platform away from social media would be great; there will never be comments or likes on this site (mostly so I can stay blissfully unaware of how unvisited this place actually is)

I know at the moments there's not much here but, as all things are, that's subject to change.

Thanks for stopping by.
