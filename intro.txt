Hello, my name is Marcus Dunn and this is my Blog (other name suggestions are appeciated). This will hopfully be around for a while (but I do say that for all my little side projects). I'm a computer science student at UVic (currently taking a semester off to start a buisness) and I want to go into politics. Naturally, I've decided to fuck myself by posting all my opinions online. Hopfully the gimmick of this blog (being able to go back and such) will show some improvment with time, or perhaps I'll become an worse with age, who's to know! 

The goal of this is to force myself to continue to write dispite taking a major that requires all of zero words. Also giving me some sort of platform away from social media would be great! There will never be comments or likes on this site (mostly so I can stay blissfully unaware of how unvisited this place actually is)

I know at the moment there's not much here but, as all things are, that's subject to change.

Thanks for stopping by.
